# Drillimation Bug Tracker
This is the official bug tracker for closed-source Drillimation games. Please use this repository to report bugs for problems you have found inside Drillimation games. Before you submit any issues, please read all of the information on the rest of this page so that you can ensure your problem is something you need to tell us and has not already been reported.

## Update your game to the current version
Make sure you update the game to ensure your problem hasn't been fixed already. If you aren't currently using the stable version of a game, please do not report something until you have confirmed the stable version still has this problem.

## Search the issue list for any existing reports
Always search the list of existing issues and ensure your problem has not already been reported. Creating duplicates will always slow us down. If your problem has already been reported, you are welcome to join the discussion by adding comments that could help us further reproduce your issue. You can also leave a thumbs up to say you're also encountering this problem.

## Fill out the form with the correct information
When submitting an issue, please fill in all fields with pertinent information you can provide. If you don't send all requested information, you may experience delays while we request what is missing. Please strongly consider sending a photo or uploading a video to help us further reproduce the issue.
